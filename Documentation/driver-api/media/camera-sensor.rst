Writing camera sensor drivers
=============================

This document covers the in-kernel APIs only. For the best practices on
userspace API implementation in camera sensor drivers, please see
:ref:`media_using_camera_sensor_drivers`.

CSI-2, parallel and BT.656 buses
--------------------------------

Please see :ref:`transmitter-receiver`.

Handling clocks
---------------

Camera sensors have an internal clock tree including a PLL and a number of
divisors. The clock tree is generally configured by the driver based on a few
input parameters that are specific to the hardware: the external clock frequency
and the link frequency. The two parameters generally are obtained from system
firmware. **No other frequencies should be used in any circumstances.**

The reason why the clock frequencies are so important is that the clock signals
come out of the SoC, and in many cases a specific frequency is designed to be
used in the system. Using another frequency may cause harmful effects
elsewhere. Therefore only the pre-determined frequencies are configurable by the
user.

ACPI
~~~~

Read the ``clock-frequency`` _DSD property to denote the frequency. The driver
can rely on this frequency being used.

Devicetree
~~~~~~~~~~

The preferred way to achieve this is using ``assigned-clocks``,
``assigned-clock-parents`` and ``assigned-clock-rates`` properties. See the
`clock device tree bindings
<https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/blob/main/dtschema/schemas/clock/clock.yaml>`_
for more information. The driver then gets the frequency using
``clk_get_rate()``.

This approach has the drawback that there's no guarantee that the frequency
hasn't been modified directly or indirectly by another driver, or supported by
the board's clock tree to begin with. Changes to the Common Clock Framework API
are required to ensure reliability.

Power management
----------------

Camera sensors are used in conjunction with other devices to form a camera
pipeline. They must obey the rules listed herein to ensure coherent power
management over the pipeline.

Camera sensor drivers are responsible for controlling the power state of the
device they otherwise control as well. They shall use runtime PM to manage power
states. Runtime PM shall be enabled at probe time using
:c:func:`pm_runtime_enable()` and disabled using :c:func:`pm_runtime_disable()`
at remove time. Before enabling Runtime PM, the device's Runtime PM status is
set to ``RPM_ACTIVE`` using :c:func:`pm_runtime_set_active()` and after
disabling set to ``RPM_SUSPENDED`` using :c:func:`pm_runtime_set_suspended()`.
Drivers should enable runtime PM autosuspend. Also see :ref:`async sub-device
registration <media-registering-async-subdevs>`.

The runtime PM handlers shall handle clocks, regulators, GPIOs, and other
system resources required to power the sensor up and down. For drivers that
don't use any of those resources (such as drivers that support ACPI systems
only), the runtime PM handlers may be left unimplemented.

In general, the device shall be powered on at least when its registers are being
accessed and when it is streaming. Drivers using autosuspend should use
:c:func:`pm_runtime_get_sync()` to ensure the device is powered on.  The
function increments Runtime PM ``usage_count`` which the driver is responsible
for decrementing using e.g. :c:func:`pm_runtime_put_mark_busy_autosusp()`, which
starts autosuspend timer to power off the device later on when its
``usage_count`` is 0, or :c:func:`pm_runtime_put()` which proceeds to power off
the device without a delay when its ``usage_count`` is 0.

Note that runtime PM ``usage_count`` of the device must be put even if
:c:func:`pm_runtime_get_sync()` fails. :c:func:`pm_runtime_get_sync()` returns 1
if the device was already powered on, which may be used as a signal for the
driver that initialisation related registers need to be written to the
sensor.

Drivers that support Devicetree shall also power on the device explicitly in
driver's probe() function and power the device off in driver's remove() function
without relying on Runtime PM.

Drivers may power the device up at probe time (for example to read
identification registers), but should not keep it powered unconditionally after
probe. On ACPI systems I²C devices are normally powered on for probe but
:ref:`this can be avoided if needed <firmware_acpi_non_d0_probe>`.

At system suspend time, the whole camera pipeline must stop streaming, and
restart when the system is resumed. This requires coordination between the
camera sensor and the rest of the camera pipeline. Bridge drivers are
responsible for this coordination, and instruct camera sensors to stop and
restart streaming by calling the appropriate subdev operations (``.s_stream()``,
``.enable_streams()`` or ``.disable_streams()``). Camera sensor drivers shall
therefore **not** keep track of the streaming state to stop streaming in the PM
suspend handler and restart it in the resume handler. Drivers should in general
not implement the system PM handlers.

Camera sensor drivers shall **not** implement the subdev ``.s_power()``
operation as it is deprecated. While this operation is implemented in some
existing drivers as they predate the deprecation, new drivers shall use runtime
PM instead. If you feel you need to begin calling ``.s_power()`` from an ISP or
a bridge driver, instead add runtime PM support to the sensor driver you are
using and drop its ``.s_power()`` handler.

Please also see :ref:`examples <media-camera-sensor-examples>`.

.. _media_writing_camera_sensor_drives_control_framework:

Control framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``v4l2_ctrl_handler_setup()`` function may not be used in the device's runtime
PM ``runtime_resume`` callback as it has no way to figure out the power state of
the device. This is because the Runtime PM status of the device is only changed
after the Runtime PM status transition has taken place. The ``s_ctrl`` callback
can be used to obtain device's Runtime PM status once the transition has taken
place:

.. c:function:: int pm_runtime_get_if_active(struct device *dev);

The function returns a non-zero value if the device is powered on (in which case
it increments the device's ``usage_count``) or runtime PM was disabled, in
either of which cases the driver may proceed to access the device. Note that the
device's ``usage_count`` is not incremented if the function returns an error, in
which case the ``usage_count`` also must not be put using
:c:func:`pm_runtime_put()` or its variants.

Rotation, orientation and flipping
----------------------------------

Use ``v4l2_fwnode_device_parse()`` to obtain rotation and orientation
information from system firmware and ``v4l2_ctrl_new_fwnode_properties()`` to
register the appropriate controls.

supported features and other qualities, particular sensor drivers better serve
